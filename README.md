WhaleSplash
===========

A little program to help those not-so-hardcore hardcore Path of Exile players (like myself) quickly exit the game in those moments of need. As long as you're playing reasonably smart, it should save you in most every other situation. This program is not going to save your character in a one-shot situation. 

This program supports both the standalone and the Steam flavors of the game client. All versions from the 1.0 release to current (1.0.6b) are supported. Given the way the program is designed, it should continue to work with all newer versions of the client barring any structural changes on their end.
